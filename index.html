        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
        Not Sus is a 2D space-themed dungeon crawler that has some inspiration from the Doom series. The player, a stranded astronaut, must fight their way through different levels of enemy slimes and fight a boss at the end. The player has 5 weapons available to them. By default they have a laser gun with infinite ammo, but they will need to find ammo from killing enemies and looting chests around the level. Doors will be locked to the player and can only be opened with cogs (keys) that drop from enemy slimes or from looting chests.
        </p>
        <p>
        The space 2D top down dungeon crawler theme is one none of had ever seen before, and is unique. We think that what will be most fun to players is the challenge of cycling between weapons, conserving ammo, and using the most effective weapon for the circumstance.
